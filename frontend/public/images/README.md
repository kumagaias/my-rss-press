# Images Directory

## Placeholder Image

This directory should contain a placeholder image for articles without images.

**Required file**: `placeholder-newspaper.jpg`

**Specifications**:
- Dimensions: 800x600 pixels (or similar aspect ratio)
- Format: JPEG or PNG
- Content: Generic newspaper-themed image (e.g., newspaper texture, generic news icon)
- Size: < 100KB recommended

**Usage**:
The `CopyrightFreeImage` component uses this image as a fallback when:
1. Unsplash Source API fails to load
2. Network errors occur
3. External image sources are unavailable

**How to add**:
1. Create or download a copyright-free newspaper-themed image
2. Save it as `placeholder-newspaper.jpg` in this directory
3. Ensure the image is optimized for web use

**Temporary solution**:
Until a proper placeholder is added, you can use a solid color or simple SVG as a temporary placeholder.
